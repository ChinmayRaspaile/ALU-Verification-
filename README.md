# Fork-Join Verification for Basic ALU in SystemVerilog

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of all SystemVerilog `fork-join` constructs (`join`, `join_any`, and `join_none`) in verifying a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, and bitwise AND.

## ALU Functionality
The ALU module accepts two 4-bit operands `a` and `b` and a 2-bit opcode `op` to perform:
- `00`: Addition (`a + b`)
- `01`: Subtraction (`a - b`)
- `10`: Bitwise AND (`a & b`)

## Verification Strategy
The testbench uses separate tasks for each ALU operation and applies:

### 1. `fork...join`
- Executes all operations in parallel.
- Waits for all to complete before proceeding.

### 2. `fork...join_any`
- Executes all operations in parallel.
- Continues once **any one** task finishes.

### 3. `fork...join_none`
- Executes all operations in parallel.
- Parent thread continues immediately **without waiting** for any task to complete.

## Files
- `design.sv`: ALU module (Device Under Test)
- `testbench.sv`: Testbench demonstrating `fork-join` constructs

## How to Run
1. Open in any SystemVerilog simulator (e.g., Vivado, ModelSim, QuestaSim)
2. Compile and simulate both `alu.sv` and `tb.sv`
3. Observe console output to see behavior of each fork-join type

## Output Example
```sh
--- fork...join ---
ADD Result: 7
SUB Result: 5
AND Result: 1000
All operations done with fork...join

--- fork...join_any ---
ADD Result: 7
First completed operation finished with fork...join_any
...

--- fork...join_none ---
Parent thread continued without waiting (fork...join_none)
...
```
Happy Coding! ðŸš€
